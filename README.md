# This-Fetchin-Weather

## Desciption 
This weather app was a lot of fun, but definitely challenging. If I had more time there's definitely some more functionality and CSS things I would like to woron. But overall I'm still pretty happy with the final result. Local Storage is one thing that has been just hard for me to get. The last few projects (includinthis one), I've needed a tutor to help me with it. But this one was finally the time where it clicked and going into the tutoring session I had a rough idea owhat I needed to do, so that's a win I suppose. Here are some of the things I would like to implement maybe sometime down the road on this project. I would likthe color of the 5 day forecasts to change depending on the weather. orange=very hot  red=some kind of weather emergency. I would like the background image tchange on refresh, and maybe implement a more fancy search bar, something with an animation would be cool.  



## Installation
 
N/A
 
## Usage
    The Weather Dashboard is super easy to use. Literally enter any city into the search bar and press the search button. The page will load with current temperature and other weather data in the main big box, then below that there is a 5 day forecast that displays a date, and each forecast card is showing the weather for the corresponding date. This uses both MomentJS, and a weather API called Open Weather. MomentJS is used for the dates on the page, and in the forecast cards, while the Open Weather api is used for all the weather data on the page! It was cool but challenging to have these both work together.
